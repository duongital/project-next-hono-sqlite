description: Create an implementation plan and save it as a markdown file
---

You are helping the user create a detailed implementation plan before writing code.

**Your task:**

1. Ask the user to describe what they want to implement
2. Create a comprehensive plan that includes:

   - Overview of the feature/task
   - Technical approach and architecture decisions
   - Step-by-step implementation steps
   - Files that need to be created or modified
   - Dependencies or libraries needed
   - Potential challenges and how to address them

3. Save the plan as a markdown file in the `./plan` directory with a descriptive filename based on the feature (e.g., `user-authentication.md`, `api-integration.md`)

4. Format the plan using clear markdown with headings, lists, and code blocks where appropriate

5. After saving, confirm the location of the plan file to the user

**Important:**

- Be thorough but concise
- Focus on actionable steps
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Include relevant technical details
- Use the current date in the plan metadata
